OpenHIM - CR/SHR Reconciliation
===============================

The OpenHIM - CR/SHR Reconciliation application periodically polls the Client Registry for identifierUpdateEvents and sends them as individual requests to the Shared Health Record.

It forms part of the OpenHIM Project (http://openhim.org) as part of the Rwandan HIE implementation (http://rhea.jembi.org), however it currently runs as an independent mule application.
